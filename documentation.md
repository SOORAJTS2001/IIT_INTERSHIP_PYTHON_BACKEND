## app.py
This code is a Flask web application for uploading, searching, playing, and downloading songs. Here is a breakdown of the main components:

Import statements:

- Flask: the main web framework used to create the application
- render_template: a function that renders a specified HTML template
- request: a module that handles incoming HTTP requests
- redirect: a function that redirects to another URL
- url_for: a function that generates a URL for a given function name
- send_file: a function that sends a file to the client as an attachment
- Flask_SQLAlchemy: an extension that provides an ORM for working with databases in Flask
- os: a module that provides a way to interact with the file system
- secure_filename: a function that generates a secure filename for a given file
- html_sanitizer: a module that provides an HTML sanitizer to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- SQLAlchemy: a Python SQL toolkit and ORM that provides a set of high-level API for working with relational databases.

App setup:

- Create an instance of the Flask class and pass in the name of the application.
- Configure the database URI using SQLite as the database engine.
- Set the upload folder for storing uploaded songs.
- Set the maximum file size to 16 MB.
- Set a secret key to enable secure sessions.
- Create a context for the application.

Define a Song model using SQLAlchemy:

- Define a table for storing song information with columns for the title, artist, album, and URL.

Define routes and views:

- The index route displays a list of all songs in the database.
- The upload route handles the uploading of a new song to the database and file system.
- The search route handles the searching of songs based on the query parameter.
- The delete route handles the deletion of a song from the database and file system.
- The play route handles the streaming of a song to the client.
- The download route handles the downloading of a song to the client.

Run the application:

- If the file is run directly (i.e. not imported as a module), start the application in debug mode.
